# BattlehipAi
A battleship ai held together by duct tape, this ai is not finished and it probably won't be any time soon as this was just a project for fun to practice pygame.

# Contros
To place a ship mouse hover over the left-most grid and click to place a ship, to rotate a ship press r.
once all the ships are placed the rightmost grid will show what the Ai is thinking and its hits/misses.
The darker the tile on the preview window the more confident the Ai is that there is a ship there.
